# LowVarS
LowVarS is a project to search for low frequency variability of extragallactic sources.

### Project Outline

1. The Data

2. Variable Search Criteria

3. Identifying variables

**What is known?**

What do we expect to find? What would be an important conclusion for this project?


**Where should we get data?**

Shoule we process new data from AVSO? Should we concentrate on a small portion of the sky?

Should we concentrate on certain frequencies? Are we considering polarized sources?


**How do we quantify a variable star?**

look for data pouints along the flair, question flares that are made of single data points

consider beam power, come up with relationship between beam power and datapoint reliability
