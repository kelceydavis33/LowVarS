# LowVarS
LowVarS is a project to search for low frequency variability of extragallactic sources.

### Project Outline

1. The Data

2. Variable Search Criteria

3. Identifying variables

**What is known?**

What do we expect to find? What would be an important conclusion for this project?

past: there have been seraches, need to consider time scales, variable due to ionospheric movement, anything done by ionosphere is spectraly smooth, but do get ionospheric activity minute to minute 

On average when sources are subtracted, are we addin or removing power? DId the source get dimmer or did we put a hole next to the source?
Differ calibration and subtraction models
Learn to run FHD


**Where should we get data?**

Shoule we process new data from AVSO? Should we concentrate on a small portion of the sky?

Should we concentrate on certain frequencies? Are we considering polarized sources?


**How do we quantify a variable star?**

look for data pouints along the flair, question flares that are made of single data points

consider beam power, come up with relationship between beam power and datapoint reliability
