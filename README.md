# LowVarS
LowVarS is a project to search for low frequency variability due to ionospheric activity in extended sources within MWA data

### Project Outline

**What is known?**

What do we expect to find? What would be an important conclusion for this project?

past: there have been seraches, need to consider time scales, variable due to ionospheric movement, anything done by ionosphere is spectraly smooth, but do get ionospheric activity minute to minute 

On average when sources are subtracted, are we addin or removing power? DId the source get dimmer or did we put a hole next to the source?

Learn to run FHD


**Where should we get data?**

Shoule we process new data from AVSO? Should we concentrate on a small portion of the sky?

Should we concentrate on certain frequencies? Are we considering polarized sources?
